Details on types of submissions and the submission procedure will be provided by the end of November 2023.

Each submission will be reviewed by three members of the Programme Committee.

All accepted papers will be included in the conference e-proceedings which will be available at the conference. The NLPAICS 2024 organisers will work with ACL to secure their inclusion in the ACL Anthology.
